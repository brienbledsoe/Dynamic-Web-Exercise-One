console.log('articleData',articleData); //added this line of code
I removed the line above because I think this is what you mean for components that are meant for logging only?

console.log('ArticleCard', articleContent); I removed this from the articleCard index.js file in the article card funtion above the
return statement


console.log('This is the current article',article) // commented out in line 22 in the home Article.Js file just in case

console.log('This is the articleData', articleData[i]); //commented out in line 14 in home Article.js file just in className

for some reason I can't adjust the span tag in my ArticleCard index.js file

2. Invalid HTML to wrap a <p> tag with another <p> tag:

3. You included both containers inside of the Home folder. You will want to give each of these their own folders inside of containers
or at least make sure the folder structure is consistent (/Home/index.js and Article/index.js)

4. You're not bringing in the article image here for the header https://github.com/brienbledsoe/Dynamic-Web-Exercise-One/blob/f7f61ce45c0b8a23b14048302ffee7543fbe0fc1/exercise-one-update/src/containers/Home/Article.js#L26


// <img src={article.image.url} alt={article.image.alt}/>//not working in article.js file
